Hi there, welcome to my homepage! My name is Wenjing Chen. I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) at Texas A&M University. I'm advised by [Dr. Victoria G.Crawford](https://people.tamu.edu/~vcrawford/). Before that, I received my MS in Electrical Engineering from Texas A&M University and my BS in applied math from University of Science and Technology of China.

My research includes combinatorial optimization (especially submodular maximization), sample-efficient algorithms in reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandits.
